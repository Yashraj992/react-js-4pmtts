                    <p>We know that during COVID-19, a lot of folks <br /> around the city and state are feeling uneasy about <br /> the future - we're not sure what the future holds <br /> either.</p><br />
                    <p>That said: we know that we love making sure you <br /> have the gear you need for your adventures, and <br /> we're going to keep doing that - with our team - <br /> until the city tells us we can't.</p> <br />
                    <p>But as long as folks like yourself support small <br /> businesses around the city, then we'll be here â€” <br /> every day, making sure your orders arrive on time.</p><br />
